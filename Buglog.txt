Bug Log
____________________________________________________________________________
Checkpoint 1:


Bug1:
Date: 10/14
Bug Description: Page faults when fast changing and typing.
How to fix: Add a ASM wrapper for the handler function to save caller-saved registers.
How long: 2 hours


Bug2:
Date: 10/15
Bug Description: Paging didn’t work because we have to set paging before enabling it.
How to fix: cr0 must be set after cr3 and cr4 are set.
How long: 6 hours


Bug3:
Date: 10/16
Bug Description: Keyboard subroutine fails to distinguish capitalization of letters.
How to fix: The transition between lowercase and uppercase suffers corner cases when it comes to letters like ‘a’ or ‘z’, which is solved by constructing two tables.
How long: 2 hours

Checkpoint 2:


Bug1:
Date: 10/21
Bug Description: Terminal read doesn’t jump out of while loop when enter flag is set.
How to fix: Enter flag is used somewhere else so the problem is solved after we change the name.
How long: 2 hours


Bug2:
Date: 10/22
Bug Description: File system page faults.
How to fix: Buffer size was too small, memory was not allocated for test buffers, position of mod_start is only “present” before page_init (save addr).
How long: 6 hours


Bug3:
Date: 10/22
Bug Description: Buffer overflow for keyboard buffer.
How to fix: if nbytes > keyboard_buf_length, nbytes = keyboard_buf_length.
How long: 4 hours


Bug4:
Date: 10/23
Bug Description: Terminal_read cannot take more than 8 characters due to using argument nbytes in the wrong way.
How to fix: Combine the null-terminator method and specified character method to determine when the string ends.
How long: 1 hour


Bug5:
Date: 10/23
Bug Description: The buffer will overflow when we type very long strings, which results into echo displaying strings that have 1 fewer character than what we have typed.
How to fix: Modified the string length check method by subtracting one space for null-terminator.
How long: 2 hours

Checkpoint 3:


Bug1:
Date: 11/12
Bug Description: Page fault on IRET.
How to fix: Not reading entrypoint correctly. From *((uint32_t *)address+24*8) to address[24] + address[25] << 8 + … (mainly due to Little Endian), another solution: (uint32_t *)address[6]
How long: 5 hours


Bug2:
Date: 11/12
Bug Description: Page fault after HALT
How to fix: PCB FOps was shared, so when we destroyed the PCB and set the FOps to NULL, the FOps for other PCBs were also set to NULL causing a page fault
How long: 6 hours


Bug3:
Date: 11/13
Bug Description: Return value for HALT in EAX is changed after JMP
How to fix: Don’t keep inline assembly in separate lines. Put inline assembly in one asm volatile(); because %0 uses any general register and it happened to choose EAX
How long: 2 hours

____________________________________________________________________________
Checkpoint 4:


Bug1:
Date: 11/22
Bug Description: Fd suddenly becomes 10 after verylargetextwithverylongname.tx
How to fix: Added null terminator to the end of string, return buffer size instead of name size.
How long: 9 hours


Bug2:
Date: 11/27
Bug Description: Vidmap function leads to crashing in system execution.
How to fix: Didn’t handle check for malicious input which isn’t pointing to the user space.
How long: 1 hour

Checkpoint 5:


Bug1:
Date: 12/3
Bug Description: Scheduling didn’t work causing many small bugs
How to fix: Save ESP and EBP upon entering the function directly into the terminal struct and only update it to the new values when just about to exit function
How long: 7 hours


Bug2:
Date:12/3
Bug Description: When switching terminals, running fish on 1st terminal doesn’t show up on other terminals, but running fish on 2nd terminal shows up on 3rd terminal
How to fix: Don’t set paging for vidmap in the vidmap function, set it when initializing paging
How long: 2 hours


Bug3:
Date: 12/3
Bug Description: Cursor jumps around when counter is running on one terminal
How to fix: Only update cursor for terminal shown on screen
How long: 2 hours


Bug4:
Date: 12/4
Bug Description: Execute counter in terminal 1 and then switch to terminal 2 or 3 and then type in the buffer, the content will overwrite “391OS >”.
How to fix: Forget to disable the interrupt while we are in the terminal write function, which could cause the writing action to be interrupted during the process, thus messing up the functionality.
How long: 5 hours


Bug5:
Date: 12/4
Bug Description: Clear screen doesn’t print “391OS> “ after clearing screen
How to fix: Properly modify clear function and deal with corner cases
How long: 3 hours


Bug6:
Date: 12/4
Bug Description: Fish runs faster on terminal 1 than terminal 2
How to fix: RTC signal is not being delivered to all terminals, solution: make there be 3 RTC_INT flags (one per terminal)
How long: 2 hours


Bug7:
Date: 12/4
Bug Description: Pingpong gets stuck every few seconds
How to fix: Initialize all rtc_init_flags and change for all handlers
How long: 1 hour
